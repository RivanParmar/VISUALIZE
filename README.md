#  Android Studio Visual Scripting Plugin
Plugin for adding Visual Scripting to Android Studio for Java and Kotlin.

# Work-In-Progress
Currently, the project has just been started and nothing much has been done and so the plugin is not yet ready for use.

# Why add Visual Scripting to Android Studio?
One of the main reasons to add Visual Scripting is obviously because Android Studio does not have it. Visual Scripting helps new developers starting with programming to easily write long codes with visual help. Unity and Unreal Engine and many others have already got Visual Scripting implemented so that freshers starting to learn coding in them can easily write codes visually which is easier than normal code writing.
