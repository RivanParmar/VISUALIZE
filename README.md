#  Android Studio Visual Scripting Plugin
[![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/RivanParmar/Android-Studio-Visual-Scripting-Plugin?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/RivanParmar/Android-Studio-Visual-Scripting-Plugin/stargazers) [![GitHub forks](https://img.shields.io/github/forks/RivanParmar/Android-Studio-Visual-Scripting-Plugin?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/RivanParmar/Android-Studio-Visual-Scripting-Plugin/network)

Plugin for adding Visual Scripting to Android Studio for Java and Kotlin. The plugin for Android Studio that will help you make your best app in Android Studio **without writing any Java or Kotlin code**!

I am looking forward to more views and stars for this project which will motivate me to finish it as fast as possible.

# Work-In-Progress
Currently, the project has just been started and nothing much has been done and so the plugin is not yet ready for use. Again, this project is highly experimental and it may take much time to reach a stable state. Your contributions can make a lot of difference!

# Why add Visual Scripting to Android Studio?
One of the main reasons to add Visual Scripting is obviously because Android Studio does not have it. Visual Scripting helps new developers starting with programming to easily write long codes with visual help. Unity and Unreal Engine and many others have already got Visual Scripting implemented so that freshers starting to learn coding in them can easily write codes visually which is easier than normal code writing.

# Visual Scripting
- Don't know what Visual Scripting (or Visual Programming) is? Check out the wiki [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_programming_language).
- Want to see how Visual Scripting works? Check out [Unity Visual Scripting](https://unity.com/products/unity-visual-scripting) or check out Google's own [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly).

# Editor Design
![Figma](https://img.shields.io/badge/Figma-F24E1E?style=for-the-badge&logo=figma&logoColor=white)

Currently, no specific designs have been made on how the Visual Editor and it's components will look. But designs will be created in Figma using the [Intellij UI Kit](https://jetbrains.design/intellij/resources/UI_kit/). So if you're interested in designing the Visual Editor and it's components, do so in Figma and share it here in the **Issues** tab with the **Feature-request** template.

# Issues and Feature-requests
[![GitHub issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/RivanParmar/Android-Studio-Visual-Scripting-Plugin?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/RivanParmar/Android-Studio-Visual-Scripting-Plugin/issues) [![GitHub issues by-label](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/RivanParmar/Android-Studio-Visual-Scripting-Plugin/good%20first%20issue?color=blueviolet&label=good%20first%20issues&style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/RivanParmar/Android-Studio-Visual-Scripting-Plugin/labels/good%20first%20issue)

Two templates - **Bug report** and **Feature request** are provided under the issues tab for creating new issues and feature-requests respectively. You can also use the **No Template** or the **Blank Template** to report an issue if the templates don't meet your requirements or the issue isn't related to the templates.
