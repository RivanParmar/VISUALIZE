#  Android Studio Visual Scripting Plugin
[![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/RivanParmar/Android-Studio-Visual-Scripting-Plugin?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/RivanParmar/Android-Studio-Visual-Scripting-Plugin/stargazers) [![GitHub forks](https://img.shields.io/github/forks/RivanParmar/Android-Studio-Visual-Scripting-Plugin?style=for-the-badge)](https://github.com/RivanParmar/Android-Studio-Visual-Scripting-Plugin/network)

Plugin for adding Visual Scripting to Android Studio for Java and Kotlin. The plugin for Android Studio that will help you make your best app in Android Studio **without writing any Java or Kotlin code**! 

If you like the project please consider giving it a **star**. I am looking forward to more views and stars for this project which will motivate me to finish it as soon as possible.

# ⚠️ Work-In-Progress
![Android Studio](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/77159650/165101089-9df4809f-66a0-45b2-934b-0ed00f39577a.png)
Currently, the project simply creates a split editor which works with Java and Kotlin files and looks as in the above screenshot and so the plugin is not yet ready for use. The "Visual Scripting Editor" is our editor. The default Android Studio editor cannot be hidden, so the other button will remain as it is. Again, this project is highly experimental and it may take much time to reach a stable state. Your contributions can make a lot of difference!

# Why add Visual Scripting to Android Studio?
One of the main reasons to add Visual Scripting is obviously because Android Studio does not have it. Visual Scripting helps new developers starting with programming to easily write long codes with visual help. Unity and Unreal Engine and many others have already got Visual Scripting implemented so that freshers starting to learn coding in them can easily write codes visually which is easier than normal code writing.

# Visual Scripting
- Don't know what Visual Scripting (or Visual Programming) is? Check out the wiki [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_programming_language).
- Want to see how Visual Scripting works? Check out [Unity Visual Scripting](https://unity.com/products/unity-visual-scripting) or check out Google's own [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly).

# Editor Design

Currently, no specific designs have been made on how the Visual Editor and it's components will look. But designs will be created in Figma using the [Intellij UI Kit](https://jetbrains.design/intellij/resources/UI_kit/). So if you're interested in designing the Visual Editor and it's components, do so in Figma and share it's photo here in the [**Discussions tab**](https://github.com/RivanParmar/Android-Studio-Visual-Scripting-Plugin/discussions/8).
